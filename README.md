## Project 1: [Mosconi Cup](https://github.com/minasso/mosconi)

This is a web scraping and data analysis project on the Mosconi Cup data from 1994 to 2016.

The Mosconi Cup is a yearly pocket billiards event during which the best players in America face off against the best players in Europe in a team 9-ball tournament. Over the last few decades, the game of pool has lost a lot of its following, and thus it has become hard to find good statistical information on the players' past performances. This project is an attempt to remedy that by providing the fans with interesting and useful stats on the sport's most entertaining annual tournament.
